        <h4>Interaction Guidance:</h4>
        <p>There are three different proposal options: lowest cost, fulfill customer quickly, or lowest business impact.
        </p>

        <p>For example, if I choose “fulfill customer quickly” proposal card. All views will be updated. The right-side
            lists all detail about how to achieve this proposal. There are two major steps: <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, for purchase order PO0198 and PO0203, we should change the supplier from
            supplier V20017 Globex to supplier V70005 Sterling Cooper, who provides the same products but is located far
            from the earthquake region. This change can cover sales order SO0724 and SO0763 <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, for the purchase order PO0173 and PO0175, we can change the supplier from
            V10002 Bluth and V30104 Smith Pearson, to supplier V40032 Tyrell Corp. So, all Product XON can be delivered
            on time.</p>

        <p>And then, I chose generating a .xls file or calling an oData service call to export the results. We can use
            the result to update the manufacturing schedule after running through an approval workflow depending on the
            volume of the order. The core manufacturing schedule can be updated accordingly and easily. </p>



        <!-- <h4>Background:</h4>
        <p>I'm a general manager of a manufacturing company, who is managing suppliers across the west coast of the USA.
            I will open an application to check business status.</p>
        <h4>Homepage:</h4>
        <p>The map shows bubbles representing suppliers and their open purchase order amounts. So, supplier Globex and
            Hooli have the largest purchase orders. And there are more statistic reports summarizing business status
            from different perspectives.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, an alert message, “Warning: an earthquake happened recently will impact sales orders. Please take
            immediate action!”, is popped up. So, I click on the notification button. </p>
        <h4>Situation page:</h4>
        <p>So, the simulated earthquake has magnitude level 7 with impact radius of 150 KM closing to Ridgecrest,
            happened yesterday, which is impacting my production plan since most of my suppliers are located in
            California. It found 7 impacted suppliers and 8 customers’ sales order will be impacted in the next 3 weeks.
            The business impact to my company is around 6.7 million USD.</p>
        <p>And, the geographic map shows the earthquake circle touching 7 suppliers. Click on the largest bubble, the
            system shows supplier V20017, Globex, who holds the largest purchase order with the volume of 1.79 Million
            USD, which will be my key focus. And the right-side panel is key performance index analysis, which shows a
            total of 1.52 Million USD of sales orders. Based on current work-in-process data from the ERP, I can only
            fulfill 0.65 Million USD of sales orders because of the earthquake impacts. And that is 57.2% sales order
            cannot be fulfilled. </p>
        <p>The previous average on-time delivery rate is 99%. But as the interrupt from the earthquake, the predicted
            on-time delivery rate will drop 12%. So, I need to make some changes to make sure the key sales orders that
            can be fulfilled.<br />
            The previous average on-time delivery rate is 99%. But as the interrupt from the earthquake, the predicted

            can be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>In general, the sales orders will be impacted at different level because related purchase orders are impacted
            differently based on the suppliers’ location. This tool connects purchase order with sales order to help
            understand their relationship. The middle circle represents my company. And the left side is the suppliers
            with different size representing the size of their purchase orders. The right side shows customers and
            related sales order information. </p>
        <p>The color represents the influence level. The red color means more risk, the blue color means less risk.
            Yellow and grey color mean medium risk.</p>
        <p>Ok, look at the numbers, the supplier V10001, Omega, having a zero point eighty-seven Million USD purchase
            order, locates right in the epicenter area. And the parts from this purchase order are main materials for
            the sales order customer C0007, Rekall Co., which is planned to be delivered in 2 weeks. </p>
        <p>Therefore, with this analysis, Omega is shown in red, and Rekall on the right side is also shown in red.
            Moreover, according to the supply chain data, purchase orders from Omega also include the accessories for
            customer Delos’s sales orders due in 4 weeks, which has a longer deliver period, so Delos is shown in yellow
        </p>
        <h4>Proposal page:</h4>
        <p>Click on the upper right corner, we can go to the Proposal page. There are three different proposal options:
            lowest cost, fulfill customer quickly, or lowest business impact.</p>

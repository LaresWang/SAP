        <h4>Interaction Guidance:</h4>
        <p>So, the simulated earthquake has magnitude level 7 with impact radius of 150 KM closing to Ridgecrest,
            happened yesterday, which is impacting my production plan since most of my suppliers are located in
            California. It found 7 impacted suppliers and 8 customers’ sales order will be impacted in the next 3 weeks.
            The business impact to my company is around 6.7 million USD.</p>

        <p>And, the geographic map shows the earthquake circle touching 7 suppliers. Click on the largest bubble, the
            system shows supplier V20017, Globex, who holds the largest purchase order with the volume of 1.79 Million
            USD, which will be my key focus. And the right-side panel is key performance index analysis, which shows a
            total of 1.52 Million USD of sales orders. Based on current work-in-process data from the ERP, I can only
            fulfill 0.65 Million USD of sales orders because of the earthquake impacts. And that is 57.2% sales order
            cannot be fulfilled. </p>

        <p>The previous average on-time delivery rate is 99%. But as the interrupt from the earthquake, the predicted
            on-time delivery rate will drop 12%. So, I need to make some changes to make sure the key sales orders that
            can be fulfilled. <br>

            can be fulfilled.</p>

        <p>In general, the sales orders will be impacted at different level because related purchase orders are impacted
            differently based on the suppliers’ location. This tool connects purchase order with sales order to help
            understand their relationship. The middle circle represents my company. And the left side is the suppliers
            with different size representing the size of their purchase orders. The right side shows customers and
            related sales order information. </p>

        <p>The color represents the influence level. The red color means more risk, the blue color means less risk.
            Yellow and grey color mean medium risk.</p>

        <p>Ok, look at the numbers, the supplier V10001, Omega, having a zero point eighty-seven Million USD purchase
            order, locates right in the epicenter area. And the parts from this purchase order are main materials for
            the sales order customer C0007, Rekall Co., which is planned to be delivered in 2 weeks. </p>

        <p>Therefore, with this analysis, Omega is shown in red, and Rekall on the right side is also shown in red.
            Moreover, according to the supply chain data, purchase orders from Omega also include the accessories for
            customer Delos’s sales orders due in 4 weeks, which has a longer deliver period, so Delos is shown in
            yellow.</p>
